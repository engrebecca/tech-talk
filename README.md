## Features
* MySQL and Sequelize create the database and store user information
  * Database with one to many, many to one, and many to many relationships
* Express defines the backend server API routes
  * GET routes to retrieve user, post, comment, and tag data
  * POST routes to add new users, posts, and comments
* React creates the application and the user interface components
    * Each page contains stateful components to keep track of user information and inputs 
    * Multiple useState hooks are utilized to access and update different states
    * UserContext provides each page with access to a validated user's information
    * React Router allows React to dynamically render page components. Users must be logged in to access the application, otherwise they are re-routed to the sign in page.
* Node.js runs JavaScript outside of the browser to allow the backend to function
* Users are authenticated using middleware in order to validate login
  * Passport, Bcrypt, Passport JWT, JSON Web Token, and Cookie Session are all utilized for authentication
* Cloudinary stores user images in cloud storage through a third party API

## Database Models

## Code
The below code demonstrates how React Router dynamically renders pages to a user if they are authenticated and logged in, otherwise it will redirect them to the sign in page. A useState hook keeps track of if a user is signed in, validated, and in a session. A UserContext Provider gives all pages access to a users information as well as the login and logout functions.

      const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
      const [checkedUser, setCheckedUser] = useState(false);
      useEffect(() => {
        refreshUser()
      }, []);

      const refreshUser = () => {
        return API.User.getCurrent()
          .then(res => {
            setUser(() => res.data || null)
            setCheckedUser(() => true)
          })
      }
      const login = (userLoginData) => {
        return API.User.login(userLoginData)
          .then(res => setUser(() => res.data || null))
      }
      const logout = () => {
        return API.User.logout()
          .then(() => setUser(() => null))
      }
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout, refreshUser }}>
      <Router>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/">{checkedUser && (user ? <Redirect to="/newsfeed" /> : <HomePage />)}</Route>
          <Route exact path="/signup">{checkedUser && (user ? <Redirect to="/newsfeed" /> : <SignUpPage />)}</Route>
          <Route exact path="/members">{checkedUser && (!user ? <Redirect to="/" /> : <MemberPage />)}</Route>
          <Route exact path="/newsfeed">{checkedUser && (!user ? <Redirect to="/" /> : <PostPage />)}</Route>
          <Route exact path="/profile">{checkedUser && (!user ? <Redirect to="/" /> : <ProfilePage />)}</Route>
          <Route path="*">
            {checkedUser && (user ? <Redirect to="/newsfeed" /> : <Redirect to="/" />)}
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    </UserContext.Provider>

The below code demonstrates how a useEffect hook calls a function that makes an API call to the server to get all posts and its associated comments and tags. React dynamically creates cards for each post plus its tags and comments.

    useEffect(() => {
        loadPosts()
    }, [commentSubmitStatus, postSubmitStatus]);

    function loadPosts() {
        API.Post.getPost()
            .then(res => {
                console.log(res.data);
                setPosts(res.data);
            })
            .catch(err => console.log(err));
    }
    {posts.map(post => {
    return (
        <Card className={classes.root, classes.card} key={post.id}>
            <Grid container wrap="nowrap" spacing={2}>
                <Grid item xs zeroMinWidth>
                    {/* Map through all the tags associated with a post and create buttons for each */}
                    {post.PostTags.map(tag => {
                        return (
                            <BtnTags tags={tag.Tag.name} key={tag.id} />
                        )
                    })}
                </Grid>
            </Grid>
            <Grid item xs zeroMinWidth>
                {/* Pass props to the PostTitle component to render each post title */}
                <PostTitle postTitle={post.title} />
                {/* Pass props to the PostComment component to render each post body text */}
                <PostComment postBody={post.body} />
                {/* Hidden comments that display when user clicks the expand more icon */}
                <Collapse in={expanded} timeout="auto" unmountOnExit>

                        {post.Comments.map(comment => {

                                <Grid container spacing={1} key={comment.id}>
                                    {/* Map through all the comments associated with a post and create a new paper component to display */}
                                    <Grid item xs={12}>
                                        <Paper className={classes.paper}>
                                            <Avatar
                                                // Pass props to the Avatar component to render each user's individual information
                                                photo={comment.User.photo}
                                            />
                                            {comment.text}
                                        </Paper>
                                    </Grid>
                                </Grid>
                            )
                        })}
                    </CardContent>
